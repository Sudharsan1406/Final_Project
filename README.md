# Final_Project
# 🛡️ Military Soldier Safety and Weapon Detection using YOLO and Computer Vision

## 📌 Overview

This project uses **YOLOv5** and **Computer Vision** techniques to detect and classify objects in military environments — such as soldiers, weapons, vehicles, and civilians — for enhanced situational awareness and battlefield safety.

Developed as part of a final academic project, this system runs in real time and features a user-friendly **Streamlit web app**.
